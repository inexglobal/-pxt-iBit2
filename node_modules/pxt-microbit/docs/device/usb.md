# Uploading programs on your micro:bit

While you're writing and testing your programs, you'll mostly be [running them
in the simulator](/device/simulator), but once you've finished your program you
can **compile** it and run it on your micro:bit.

The basic steps are:

1. Connect your @boardname@ to your computer via USB
2. Click **Download** to download the `.hex` file
3. Move the `.hex` file from your computer onto the MICROBIT drive

### ~ hint

In Edge, Internet Explorer and Firefox, you can click on the **Save As** button on the bottom bar and save the ``.hex`` file
directly into the MICROBIT drive!
